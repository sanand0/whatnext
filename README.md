What Next?
==========

Sometimes, it's hard to figure out what to do next.

One classic approach is to list all your items, rate them on an urgency and
importance scale, and pick those on the top right quadrant. Stephen Covey
explains this in his book [First Things
First](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book).

This can be generalised. Almost anything can be prioritised on a grid.

This page is an **offline single-page app** that lets you add things and move
them around. You can pick your axis scales. Everything's saved in your
browser and available the next time you visit. (But it won't be available
in other browsers or for other people.)
